# Unity Dialogue

This is a simple, generic system for rpg style dialogue in unity. The dialogue window is in the style of many classic 2D rpgs. As the window is meant to be large, interactable, and to draw the attention of the user this is probably best for use without voice acting. 
Dialogue can be triggered from anywhere in the scene and will be sent to the dialogue manager which handles display to the user.
Individual lines of dialogue as well as the speaker can be specified within the Unity editor.
All scripts are well commented and this system should be easily extended to fit any needs.
